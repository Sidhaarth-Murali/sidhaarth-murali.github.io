## About Me

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), focusing on AI Safety & Alignment, World Models, and Reinforcement Learning.

I want to move beyond "natural token processing" (next-token prediction) toward models that learn from delayed rewards and structured tasks. My research centers on building foundations for reasoning in complex multi-turn tasks, treating research as a sustained effort — something I'm willing to dedicate years to, until I feel I've made real progress toward solving the problem, not just incremental advances.

## Research Areas

- **AI Safety & Alignment**: Developing frameworks for safe AI systems
- **World Models**: Building representations for embodied agents
- **Hierarchical RL**: Multi-turn reasoning and credit assignment
- **Embodied Agents**: Integrating reasoning into real-world action

## What I've Done

- **GRILL**: Developed a solver–guider framework for hierarchical credit assignment in LLMs, showing gains on MBPP and MATH500 benchmarks compared to GRPO
- **SELF-PERCEPT**: Introspection Improves LLMs' Detection of Multi-Person Mental Manipulation (ACL Main 2025)
- **DeepTeam**: Agentic red-teaming framework for LLM safety evaluation
- **Hands-on Experience**: Training/evaluating LLaMA models, building ToM benchmarks, information retrieval for medical QA systems
- **Stabilization Strategies**: Explored RLHF-style optimization under noisy guider signals

## What I Want to Do Next

- **General Long Credit Assignment**: Extend hierarchical RL approaches to settings beyond program synthesis and math reasoning, addressing tasks with deeply delayed feedback
- **World Models Beyond Language**: Investigate models that integrate language with other reasoning modalities (spatial, visual, procedural)
- **Grounded Instruction Following**: Study how agents can learn structured policies that adapt to complex instructions and partially observable environments

## Experience

- **IBM Research** (2025): AI Research Intern, alignment and safety work
- **Confident AI** (YC W25, 2025): Built DeepTeam, scaled to 600+ GitHub stars
- **University of Maryland**: Collaboration on synthetic data generation and multimodal model improvement
