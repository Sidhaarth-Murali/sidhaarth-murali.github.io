## About Me

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), focusing on AI Safety & Alignment, World Models, and Reinforcement Learning.

My research centers on building foundations for reasoning in complex multi-turn tasks. I work on long-horizon reward modeling for complex reasoning tasks using hierarchical reinforcement learning, addressing the challenge of credit assignment over extended timeframes.

## Research Areas

- **AI Safety & Alignment**: Developing frameworks for safe AI systems
- **World Models**: Building representations for embodied agents
- **Hierarchical RL**: Multi-turn reasoning and credit assignment
- **Embodied Agents**: Integrating reasoning into real-world action

## Recent Work

- **GRILL**: Guided Self-Correction in LLMs via Hierarchical Multi-Turn RL (NeurIPS 2025, under review)
- **SELF-PERCEPT**: Introspection Improves LLMs' Detection of Multi-Person Mental Manipulation (ACL Main 2025)
- **DeepTeam**: Agentic red-teaming framework for LLM safety evaluation

## Experience

- **IBM Research** (2025): AI Research Intern, alignment and safety work
- **Confident AI** (YC W25, 2025): Built DeepTeam, scaled to 600+ GitHub stars
- **University of Maryland**: Collaboration on synthetic data generation and multimodal model improvement
