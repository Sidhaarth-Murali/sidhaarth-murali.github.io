          <div class="bio">
            <p>Hi! I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) (Fall 2025), focusing on AI Safety & Alignment, World Models, and Reinforcement Learning.</p>
            
            <p>I want to move beyond "natural token processing" (next-token prediction) toward models that learn from delayed rewards and structured tasks. My research centers on building foundations for reasoning in complex multi‑turn tasks, treating research as a sustained effort — something I'm willing to dedicate years to, until I feel I've made real progress toward solving the problem, not just incremental advances.</p>
            
            <p>With Dr. Amrit Singh Bedi at UCF, I developed GRILL, a solver–guider framework for hierarchical credit assignment in LLMs, which showed gains on MBPP and MATH500 benchmarks compared to GRPO. I've explored stabilization strategies for RLHF-style optimization under noisy guider signals, with hands-on experience training/evaluating LLaMA models, building ToM benchmarks, and working on information retrieval for medical QA systems. I've also built red-teaming tools and frameworks for AI safety evaluation.</p>
            
            <p>Looking forward, I want to extend hierarchical RL approaches to settings beyond program synthesis and math reasoning, addressing tasks with deeply delayed feedback. I'm interested in world models beyond language — investigating models that integrate language with other reasoning modalities (spatial, visual, procedural), and studying how agents can learn structured policies that adapt to complex instructions and partially observable environments.</p>
            
            <p>In parallel, I focus on safety and alignment. At Confident AI (YC W25), I built and open‑sourced DeepTeam, a red‑teaming framework for automated adversarial testing of LLMs. I also studied manipulative behavior in language models, resulting in an ACL 2025 main conference paper introducing a new benchmark for manipulation detection. I was recognized with the IndiaAI Fellowship and Travel Grant (2025) and the ACL 2024 Diversity & Inclusion Grant.</p>
            
            <p>During my undergraduate years at NITK, I worked under <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anand-kumar-m-6b53b2104/">Dr. Anand Kumar M</a> on backdoor attacks in large language models (LLMs). I also interned in HALE Lab with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sowmya-kamath-nitk/">Dr. Sowmya Kamath</a> on biomedical RAG for question answering.</p>
